The "main.R" file lists all the different scripts (see the "subscripts/" folder) that were generated, starting from the processing of raw sequencing reads and up to figure panels.
Script names should be self-explanatory, with additional comments linking them to the corresponding figure panel when relevant.

All custom functions that were generated were wrapped into a R package that was made publicly available: https://github.com/vloubiere/vlfunction/tree/nature_v2_revised.
The package can be installed using: install_github("https://github.com/vloubiere/vlfunction/tree/nature_v2_revised")
